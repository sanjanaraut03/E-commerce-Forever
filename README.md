ðŸš€ Full-Stack eCommerce Website (MERN Stack)

I developed a full-stack eCommerce website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project includes:

React.js Front-End: Product listings, shopping cart, and user authentication.
Node.js & Express.js Back-End: APIs for product management, user login, and JWT-based authentication.
MongoDB: Store product and user data efficiently.
Admin Panel: Add, update, and delete products.
This project demonstrates my ability to build a complete eCommerce solution from scratch.
